# WONKA: A Digital Personal Assistant Webapp
WONKA is a sleek, user friendly web application designed to streamline task management for administrators who oversee their respective teams in their management. With an emphasis on intuitive navigation and visually appealing design, WONKA provides a cohesive platform for various administrative tasks.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javescript, Flask
The frontend of our website was designed with a focus on simplicity and easy navigation. Using HTML, we defined the structure of each page, including pages that users are redirected to after clicking on certain features. With CSS, this helped us to ensure consistent styling across all pages as well as neaten the code for each page, which was stored in a separate folder for organisation. Therefore, this helped us with ensuring a seamless interface that aligns with functionality and style.
WONKA also has a Flask backend through JavaScript's asynchronous async/await calls. Flask provides a lightweight yet robust backend for API management. The use of async/await in JavaScript enables smooth, non-blocking communication between the front and back ends, enhancing performance and user experience.

## Challenges Faced 
We wanted to implement speech-to-text functionalities for the features to enhance convenience for the administrators. However, we faced a time-constraint and we chose to focus on developing the main features. Furthermore, while we intended to integrate OpenAI API for email summarization and Google Calendar API for scheduling meetings, we faced some challenges that we could not resolve. Hence, our web app resembles our intended idea. We wish to fully implement the APIs so that widgets will be completely interactive while also improving the convenience of carrying out tasks.

## What We Learnt
Each of us took on the process of creating a frontend and backend of a website for the first time in great complexity, especially since we wanted to integrate APIs into our website. We hence gained greater appreciation for web and full-stack developers after dedicating ourselves to this project for the past few days. We also learnt and honed new skills, such as mastering languages used (HTML, CSS) and creating databases for our backend data. Overall, the creation of WONKA further introduced us to the complicated, yet beautiful language of coding to innovate and create new products to help others, and we cannot wait to get started on more projects to better hone our skills as coders.
