# WONKA: A Digital Personal Assistant Webapp
WONKA is a sleek, user friendly web application designed to streamline task management for administrators who oversee their respective teams in their management. With an emphasis on intuitive navigation and visually appealing design, WONKA provides a cohesive platform for various administrative tasks.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javescript, Bootstrap
The frontend of our website was designed with a focus on simplicity and easy navigation. Using HTML, we defined the structure of each page, including pages that users are redirected to after clicking on certain features. With CSS, this helped us to ensure consistent styling across all pages as well as neaten the code for each page, which was stored in a separate folder for organisation. Therefore, this helped us with ensuring a seamless interface that aligns with functionality and style.
